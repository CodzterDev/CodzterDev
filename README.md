# Hi There👋 Zaid here ofc

I am 17 and I find programming very interesting.
I am kinda shy to show my face, so here is a photo which I clicked using a snapchat filter.

*I am looking hot asf* 😏😂

Anyway, that was cringe. 

Umm...let's see- OH YEAH! I forgot to tell you my dream. I want to- no, I will go to IIT Delhi for sure 100% on god (okay, i think thats a little too much, BUT you get the idea right!)

**Why?** You may ask. Well, ![paisahipaisahogameme](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/39582467/159052602-1731955b-c077-44f6-9cf6-5b28c127960b.jpg)

HAHAHA

So anyway, you can go ahead and check some of my "bachho wale" projects. I am going to build OP projects when I enter college (IIT Delhi, yk 😏). So till then, bye-bye and see ya soon bois and gurls lol.
